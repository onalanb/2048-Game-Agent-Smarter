# 2048-Game-Agent-Smarter
Plays through a game of 2048 starting from a random initial state of two 2s on a 4x4 2D array. It plays through the game using two separate local search algorithms, one picks a random local path, the other picks the best local path that results in the highest score. The game is played until one of the values in the 2D array hits 2048 or if there are no valid moves left. Output pushed to "2048_out.txt" where you can observe the final state of the array for each algorithm, the path that was taken to get to the current state, and how many moves have occurred before the game ended.
